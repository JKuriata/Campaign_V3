# The Players 

I would sincerely hope you guys know who you are but for the one or two people who clearly got lost on the internet and opened this website somehow let me introduce our players!

Kami Jagla is playing <a href="August">August</a>, she did the portrait for them as well as many other drawings of our beloved thembo. Like most of us she is an absolute weeb and has a great taste in music (totally not biased because it's the same as mine). She is hawt and her favourite colour is orange!

Terry Marks is playing <a href="Gideon">Gideon</a>, he is our main artist currently, drawing session pics as well as misc character profiles. He is married to Edelgard from Fire Emblem Three houses (which works out well because Dimitri is mine). He is a good egg and his favourite colour is green!

Darragh Kempson is playing <a href="Viggo">Viggo</a>, he has written up most of the world lore as the world was originally developed by him. I played in many of his campaigns and slowly fell in love with the world so now it's my turn to have a shot at it. His favourite colour is also green.

Hello, yes, I am a player, deffo, playing all the NPC's, enemies, love interests and that table over there! (The table raises a leg and waver it... You think it may be a mimic). I'm Jude Kuriata and I am running this shitshow... I mean this perfectly planned out campaign? ha ha ha... what is going on? I'm also the reason this website exists, on the upside, far worse things have been uploaded to the internet. Oh ye, my favourite colour is either yellow or blue.
