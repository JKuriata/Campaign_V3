# Trinity Campus
An architectural marvel in the centre of Dublin, Trinity campus has served as the headquarters of the Scientists for decades.

Originally a secondary outpost, the campus quickly rose in importance following the cursing of Tara and the beginning of Spiritbane. Its archives serve as the largest collection of scientific knowledge the world over. Its Scientifically enhanced underground areas contain books, artifacts, and experiments that tell the story of Science and the world sparing very few details.

In order to complete their studies a Scientist must undergo test set by the leading council of Trinity campus, with many travelling to the campus itself to prepare. Despite its importance, Trinity was abandoned during the great expansion 3 months ago. Those scientists willing to stay behind and risk the wrath of the rumoured ‘Michael’, have taken refuge in the ritually protected halls and bunkers beneath the camps. There they can be guaranteed a modicum of safety, though their number is small.

The buildings themselves are old, their stones well protected by a century of reinforced rituals. They include lecture halls, fighting arenas, training areas, offices, laboratories, classrooms and even accommodation, as well as a large spiral dungeon where the Scientists once kept heretics and other such ilk prior to execution or punishment. 

The architecture calls back to darker times, with many courtyards, walls and plinths, both inside and out, bearing the haunting faces of screaming creatures. These of course have led to many an urban legend, with some even reporting the sounds of faint screaming, or slight movements in the stone. Others have reported the appearance of new faces, though this is less common. The Professor takes the time to personally attend to those who are heard to speak of such, acting in truly generous fashion considering his position as head of the campus. 

The trees growing within the main courtyard have been cultivated to be used for foci, the wood enchanted since first sprout, and have been rumoured to speak to certain scholars, though most of those reports have been dismissed. 

In essence Trinity provides a stable figurehead for the Scientific community in Ireland. Well known globally, and birthplace of the majority of the most useful inventions from the past century, its loss has been a hard hit to the status of Dublin as a Scientific capital.
