## About me!
### Motivations

Curiosity, developing their craft, finding new materials to work with, making friends

### Typical Day

Wake up before sunrise, take a walk, start the forge, work, then finish up for dinner and the evening with some flowers, take a nightly walk

### History

Country bumpkin blacksmith travelling to peddle some wares to the city folk when business got slow back home. Used a lot of resources to get to the city only for the Wall to put a spanner in the works. Besides, the wall seems to be made of some interesting material. Maybe it can be used? And who are these friendly looking faces?
