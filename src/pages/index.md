# Spectre
## Exit Right, pursued by Light
<img id="art" src="images/Exit-Right.jpg" alt="Gideon and Liz escaping from 'The Light'">
It was a pretty typical day for Gideon, he started off a little hungover in somebody else's bed, <a href="Liz">Liz's</a> to be precise. She helps him get ready for the day and he heads out to an audition. At the audition he meets another man auditioning for Cleon who seems to think auditioning would be "funny"... He did not appreciate this but managed to keep calm. When he was called he acted his little heart out and as always was told he would hear back if he got it.

After the audition he was approached by the assistant director who wanted to test how... dedicated he was to getting the part. Not that he had much of a say in hiring, as he revealed after the deed was done. Just another day as a struggling actor.
After a few days he found out he didn't get the role, Liz reassured him that they made a mistake and that he should have gotten it but it was difficult to lift his spirits. 

That day at work he overheard a group of people talking about <a href="the-wall">The Wall</a>. Apparently, after 3 months of inactivity <a href="the-wall">The Wall</a> has begun to pulsate again. Gideon manages to charm the group discussing it and meets a man named Viktor who owns an antiques shop near <a href="the-wall">The Wall</a> called, "Snowglobe Antiques", this man claims he has seen people going in and out through the wall, despite the official statement saying it is impossible; he also warns Gideon to not be so open of his dislike of Scientist.

On his way back from work he is met by <a href="Liz">Liz</a> who gifts him a script, explaining she got him an audition to try to cheer him up. As they talk they begin to hear a rumbling. It draws closer, they run, but soon <a href="the-wall">The Wall</a> catches up with them and they are swallowed by it. 

They feel as if they disintegrated, as if somebody took a cheesegrater to their soul and they watched it all from one crumb. 
<a href="the-wall">The Wall</a> is then in front of them. They are back but still feel the violation on their existence. They rush to <a href="Liz">Liz's</a> place and try to make each other feel whole again.


They are awoken by a light and screams outside. After this repeats they make the decision to run. They dress in a hurry and run in any direction away from the light. As they run a window above them shatters and a person falls out, the light touches their ankle and they disintegrate into dust. 
They get onto a main road and join the crowds trying to get a way. From the corner of his eyes Gideon sees the light. It was on the main road too now. 
At one point Gideon braves looking back and sees a man inside the light, the man is difficult to make out but the sword he wields is the source of the pulsing lights. The man seems to notice the two running away and in a blink he is in front of them. Before they have time to react the man plunges the sword into the ground and rotates it. The light engulfs them both. Gideon is left standing but as he looks to Liz she is gone, only the feeling of ash in his hand remaining.

Gideon ran until his lungs burned, unable to process all the ways things had gone wrong. As he is hidden in an alley he is spotted by <a href="the-help">Stephen</a> who offers him a safe place to stay.

Dublin has been in chaos for a while now, first the Morrigan tried to come back using some posh tin of tuna, then the void/madness and then the goddamn wall. Thebes is sounding like a nice holiday destination right about now. Yet, for some reason you're here. The wall separates the city in half and nobody on the outside knows exactly what is happening inside.
You've heard rumours here and there, something about a cult? It's odd to think of that sort of thing happening just beyond the wall... But then again you have heard or seen some of the previous near world-ending events in the city so it kinda does make sense.
The wall stopped expanding three months ago after it took over half the city. The scientists still monitor it and experiment in an attempt to get Trinity campus back. Oh and of course, to guard the peace and save the poor souls trapped inside the wall.
