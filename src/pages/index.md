# Spectre
## Words of the Gods

<img id="art" src="images/Viggo-in-forest.png" alt="Viggo approaching the mysterious figure by the fire after his death.">

Viggo started his day in a good mood. The night before may not have been fruitful but the drink had been good and the fighting glorious. It was with this mindset that he entered the evening’s target: Pub name. The place was mostly empty at first, the few patrons merely nodding his way as he nabbed the best drink he could muster. Dublin had really gone downhill since his last visit, not a drop of good mead to be found. 

Sipping and humming to himself, Reidar kept his ears on alert, listening for any information that might lead him to the great halls of Odin. His curiosity was peaked by a group of gentlemen discussing a strange Seidr that they had spotted by the wall. As good a chance as any, he took the opportunity to enter the conversation, much to the discomfort and anger of the men. After offering a round of drinks (anything but beer), he learnt of strange goings on by the wall. The movement seemed to be starting up again. 

As the evening wore on many of the men faded away leaving Viggo to the company of Seamus, a kind wine drinker who seemed to take a shine to Reidar’s straight forward ways. After a good chat and more than a few drinks (trying to keep up with Reidar was certainly a choice), Seamus was a little worse for wear. Being the man he is Reidar was kind enough to help Seamus home, a task that took quite a bit of effort. 

While on the hunt for Seamus’s house however, things went from strange to downright insane. Viggo was forced to stand against an oncoming rush of terrified people as the Wall grew once more. Convinced there was more to this, and that the Seidr may lead him to his goals Viggo helped Seamus home and went looking for the source. 

At a bridge across the Liffey he came face to face with someone new. Standing tall with blonde hair and glasses, a figure carrying a large sword faced down the wrath of Reidar. After challenging the man to a duel and refusing a proffered sword, Viggo was instead given a blade that seemed to be made of a Jawbone. Prepared to face anything that came, Reidar and the man fought long and hard. When at last the man proved the winner, a sword deep in Reidar’s chest, Viggo rejoiced. Now at last his Hugr would be free of this place, now at last he would enter the halls of Odin in Valhalla. 

His final breaths came with a broad smile, it had been a good battle, a death filled with glory. When he opened his eyes however he was not faced with the glorious hall, rather he found himself at a campfire, his only companion the hooded figure of an ancient man. Confused and frustrated, for this had been his goal for many a moon, Viggo at first raged at the result. This was quickly sorted however, by the calm voice of the figure. 

It was Odin who sat before him, and he had a task for his final Viking. Reidar was to return, return and fight to save the people of Dublin and uncover the secrets of the Seidr that had so trapped many a Hugr. With renewed vigour Reidar accepted the task from the All-Father, honoured to be so chosen. 

He awoke once more to an empty bridge, the strange blade still clasped in his fingers. Once up and moving he came across yet another new face, this time of a man who was helping to get others to safety. He introduced himself as Stephen O’Connolly and informed Viggo of the nature of the weapon he held. This led Reidar to perform a ritual, with the aim of destroying the foul thing. Instead however, he merely managed to separate a tooth from the bone. Viggo now knew the strength of the Seidr employed by these strangers was nothing to scoff at. At the prompting of Stephen, Viggo consigned the broken tooth to the Liffey, sending it out to sea, and hid the blade, both in the hopes of removing so foul a weapon from the enemy. 

Convinced of Stephen’s genuine nature, Reidar offered his assistance. He had a quest from the All-Father himself and not even Hel would stand in his way.

## Exit Right, pursued by Light

<img id="art" src="images/ExitRight.jpg" alt="Gideon and Liz escaping from 'The Light'">
It was a pretty typical day for Gideon, he started off a little hungover in somebody else's bed, <a href="Liz">Liz's</a> to be precise. She helps him get ready for the day and he heads out to an audition. At the audition he meets another man auditioning for Cleon who seems to think auditioning would be "funny"... He did not appreciate this but managed to keep calm. When he was called he acted his little heart out and as always was told he would hear back if he got it.

After the audition he was approached by the assistant director who wanted to test how... dedicated he was to getting the part. Not that he had much of a say in hiring, as he revealed after the deed was done. Just another day as a struggling actor.
After a few days he found out he didn't get the role, Liz reassured him that they made a mistake and that he should have gotten it but it was difficult to lift his spirits. 

That day at work he overheard a group of people talking about <a href="the-wall">The Wall</a>. Apparently, after 3 months of inactivity <a href="the-wall">The Wall</a> has begun to pulsate again. Gideon manages to charm the group discussing it and meets a man named Viktor who owns an antiques shop near <a href="the-wall">The Wall</a> called, "Snowglobe Antiques", this man claims he has seen people going in and out through the wall, despite the official statement saying it is impossible; he also warns Gideon to not be so open of his dislike of Scientist.

On his way back from work he is met by <a href="Liz">Liz</a> who gifts him a script, explaining she got him an audition to try to cheer him up. As they talk they begin to hear a rumbling. It draws closer, they run, but soon <a href="the-wall">The Wall</a> catches up with them and they are swallowed by it. 

They feel as if they disintegrated, as if somebody took a cheesegrater to their soul and they watched it all from one crumb. 
<a href="the-wall">The Wall</a> is then in front of them. They are back but still feel the violation on their existence. They rush to <a href="Liz">Liz's</a> place and try to make each other feel whole again.


They are awoken by a light and screams outside. After this repeats they make the decision to run. They dress in a hurry and run in any direction away from the light. As they run a window above them shatters and a person falls out, the light touches their ankle and they disintegrate into dust. 
They get onto a main road and join the crowds trying to get a way. From the corner of his eyes Gideon sees the light. It was on the main road too now. 
At one point Gideon braves looking back and sees a man inside the light, the man is difficult to make out but the sword he wields is the source of the pulsing lights. The man seems to notice the two running away and in a blink he is in front of them. Before they have time to react the man plunges the sword into the ground and rotates it. The light engulfs them both. Gideon is left standing but as he looks to Liz she is gone, only the feeling of ash in his hand remaining.

Gideon ran until his lungs burned, unable to process all the ways things had gone wrong. As he is hidden in an alley he is spotted by <a href="the-help">Stephen</a> who offers him a safe place to stay.

## Session 0
<img id="art" src="images/moving to sparta.gif" alt="Gif of the people of Thebes deciding to move to Sparta">
Dublin has been in chaos for a while now, first the Morrigan tried to come back using some posh tin of tuna, then the void/madness and then the goddamn wall. Thebes is sounding like a nice holiday destination right about now. Yet, for some reason you're here. The wall separates the city in half and nobody on the outside knows exactly what is happening inside.
You've heard rumours here and there, something about a cult? It's odd to think of that sort of thing happening just beyond the wall... But then again you have heard or seen some of the previous near world-ending events in the city so it kinda does make sense.
The wall stopped expanding three months ago after it took over half the city. The scientists still monitor it and experiment in an attempt to get Trinity campus back. Oh and of course, to guard the peace and save the poor souls trapped inside the wall.
