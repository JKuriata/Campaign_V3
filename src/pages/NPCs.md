# Non-Player Characters
Along your journey you will meet a few interesting characters, some will be there to help others to hinder. And if I can GM well enough, you will not be able to tell which is which. 

So far all party members have met <a href="the-help">Stephen</a> who seems to have prepared for the walls expansion and is attempting to save as many people as possible.
